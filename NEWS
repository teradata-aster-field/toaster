toaster 0.5.4
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Both explicit and implicit support for kmeans functions in AAF 6.21. 
  Package will recognize versions based on the function's output or 
  using new argument version. since new output now includes more
  kmeans statistics computeKmeans will run faster with newer
  version of AAF (#56).

* Kmeans clustering can now persist clustered data for both optimized
  performance and convinience using new argument persist=TRUE (#56).
  
* Kmeans clustering now supports initial centers obtained with canopy
  clustering. Use new functinality computeCanopy to quickly seed
  initial centroids and run kmeans with canopy object (#61).

MINOR FEATURES

* Compute functions computeAggregates, computeBarchart, computeSample
  now allow passing any parameter to sqlQuery via ... syntax to better 
  control performance and data type conversion (#60).
  
* computeClusterSample now includes id by default (#60).

* createClusterPairsPlot added argument include and except to selectively
  control features to plot (#63).

BUG FIXES

* Updated createClusterPairsPlot to work with the latest version of
  GGally (#62).

toaster 0.5.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Graph function `computeGraphClusters` performs various types
  of graph decomposition including connected components and  
  modularity (future release) (#33).
  
* Graph function `computeGraphClustersAsGraphs` uses community object
  produced by `computeGraphClusters` to create graphs corresponding
  to its components (#33).
  
* Function `validateGraph` validates and tests for consistency graph 
  tables in Aster (#34).
  
* Function `computeSample` now supports sample stratum based on 
  table column or custom stratum condition (#28).
  
* Function `getTableCounts` is handy when reviewing database tables 
  first time: it reports the number of rows and columns in each 
  table (#50).
  
* Function `computeCorrelations` now supports group columns in Aster
  (with argument `by`) (#49).
  
MINOR FEATURES

* Graph vertices table is now always read when constructing 
  corresponding network object (#46).
  
* Minimal graph must have single vertex and no edges (#42).

* All plotting functions now support subtitle (#41).

* Deprecated function theme_empty - use ggplot2::theme_void 
  instead (#53).
  
BUG FIXES

* `getTableSummary` fails when table has one or more temporal column
  types (#37)
  
* `getTablesummary` fails when numerical data contains 'NaN' or other
  special values (#39, #51)

* `computeHeatmap` argument `by` now supports multiple columns 
  to group results (#44).

* Temporary table names allow underscore characters now (#40).
  
toaster 0.5.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* New graph functionality expands toaster's reach to Aster graph
  engine and SQL/GR functions (#32). 
  
  Simply define a metadata 'toagraph' object that describes a graph 
  data in Aster (one object per graph) to compute various graph 
  metrics and distributions:
   - `computeGraphHistogram` returns degree, clustering, 
   shortest path, and various centrality measure distributions;
   - `computeGraphMetric` returns top graph vertices for 
   given graph metric including degree, local clustering, and
   various centrality measures.
  
  New functions `computeGraph`, 'showGraph`, and `computeEgoGraph`
  query Aster graph data to filter, inspect and visualize whole 
  or sub-graphs, including ego graphs (neighborhood graphs).

MINOR FEATURES

* `getTableSummary` can skip computing percentiles by setting
  percentiles value to logical \code{FALSE} (#31).

* `getNullCounts()` new argument support percent and data frame
   with no factors (#29).
   
* `isTable` now supports schema in table name, queries (by returning
  NA), and expanded result format (#30).

toaster 0.4.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

MINOR FEATURES

* `createMap` support for:
    - locationName is a vector of the column names containing address, 
      name, etc. suitable to geocode (find latitude and longitude). 
      The columns are used in order of appearance: geocoding tries 
      1st column's values first, then, for the data points that didn't 
      get resolved, it tries the 2d column's values, and so on.
    - shape's fill using 2d metric with argument `metrics`. This deprecates 
      parameter `metricName` (#25);
    - transparency control argument `shapeAlpha` for the shapes on 
      the map (#24);
    - new shape and stroke arguments `shape` and `shapeStroke` to manage 
      appearance of artifacts on the map.
      
* all plotting functions gain new guide parameter(s) that control 
  appearance of fill, size and other legend(s) using ggplot2 
  guide object name or object itself.
  
BUG FIXES

* Kmeans cluster and total within sum of squares calculations now
  work when `scale=FALSE`. (fixes #23)
  
* Kmeans SQL is correct now when `id` is exactly one of the table columns 
  and default `aliasId`. (fixes #22)
  
* `showData` now uses same default theme_tufte as the rest of plotting 
  functions (missed it 0.4.1).

* fixed histograms in `showData` after upgrading to ggplot2 2.0.0 
  (missed it 0.4.1).

toaster 0.4.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* K-means clustering function performs in-database data prep, scaling, 
  clustering, computing standard k-means measures and aggregated metrics 
  on produced clusters. Other functions include the silhouette method of 
  evaluating cluster consistency and validity and variety of 
  visualizations options. Result of k-means function is compatible with
  stats 'kmeans' object. 
  
* Utility getNullCounts function returns NULL counts per column 
  in the table.

MINOR FEATURES

* Upgraded plotting to ggplot2 2.0.0 and fixed test faiures attributed
  to this upgrade.
* Changed default theme settings to theme_tufte from ggthemes package
  for all plotting (create) functions.
* Updated some examples in the documentation.
* Added validation of RODBC connection (except checking for live 
  connection to a database).


toaster 0.3.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* New text analysis functions `computeTf` and `computeTfIdf` 
  process corpora in Aster and produce results compatible with package tm,
  in particular term document matrix.

* Both `computeTf` and `computeTfIdf` rank terms to return top ranked 
  ones. Ranking and number of terms to return are provided by 
  parameters `top` and `rankFunction`. Unlimited (all terms) are 
  returned by default with `top = NULL`.

* S3 classes `nGram` and `token` provide pluggable parsers to extract text
  tokens to use in the functions 'computeTf' and 'computeTfIdf'.

* Text functions support stop words in both Aster (installed stopwords file)
  and R (post-processing of results).

* Linear regression now is compatible with R standard lm functions returning
  object of both classes c('toalm', 'lm'). This means methods `summary`, 
  `coefficients`, etc. work with the object returned by `computeLm`.
  This change is not backward compatible: to obtain result returned in 0.2.5 
  list contains element `old.result`.

* To compute results similar to `lm` `computeLm` uses sample (default 1000 
  rows) to calculate stats like residuals, R-square, etc. in Aster. As before, 
  linear regression coefficients are calculated on full data set with
  SQL/MR linreg function.

* `getTableSummary` is enabled for parallel execution. Simply create and 
  register parallel cluster of your choice with doParallel package and set
  parameter parallel=TRUE. Performance gains may be up to 50% or better 
  depending on size of the table, number of parallel processes, and number 
  of columns. Run `demo("baseball-parallel")` for examples.

* `computePercentiles` is enabled for parallel execution. Simply create and
  register parallel cluster of your choice with doParallel package and set
  parameter parallel=TRUE. Performance gains may be up to 50% or better 
  depending on size of the table, number of parallel processes, and number 
  of columns. Run `demo("baseball-parallel")` for examples.

* Added support of temporal Aster data types in `getTableSummary` and
  `computePercentiles`. Temporal types are date, time, timestamp, and interval.
  in `computePercentiles` set parameter temporal=TRUE to calculate 
  temporal columns and run it separately from numerical ones.

MINOR FEATURES

* Added factory functions `getDiscretePaletteFactory` and `getGradientPaletteFactory`
  to dynamically generate palettes with n number of colors. 

* Added utility function `isTable` that checks if tables exist in Aster database.

* Parameter `formula` replaced defunct `expr` in the function `computeLm` 
  for consistency with other model-fitting functions.

* `computePercentiles` now operates on multiple columns at once.

* Improved database error handling to be more robust and informative. Error messages
  now include both ODBC and Aster error message and information (when applicable).

* Added deprecated warning facility `toa_dep` similar to ggplot2 gg_dep 
  function.

BUG FIXES

* Legend position in `showData` histogram format is completely removed if 
  legendPosition="none".

* `computePercentiles` now returns no rows for the column that contains all NULLs. 
  Before it threw error without completing.

* fixed legend position in plotting functions.

* Added error when histogram start value is greater than end value in (Issue #33)


DOCUMENTAION

* Completely reworked demo scripts. Now they contain fully functional examples  
  running on baseball and openDallas data sets. The data sets are available 
  from github: https://bitbucket.org/grigory/toaster/downloads
    - baseball demo: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/teradata-aster-field/toaster/downloads/baseball.zip
    - Dallas demo: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/teradata-aster-field/toaster/downloads/dallasopendata.zip

* Baseball Lahman data set now includes 2013 season.


toaster 0.2.5
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* `computeSample`: randomly sample data from the table specifying
  fraction or size of desired data set.

* `createMap`: new visualization function for combining maps with data 
  artifacts from Aster database. Can be used to produce maps of 
  arbitrary scale (with exception of whole world) and type with shapes
  of size and labels corresponding to data computed in Aster. It uses 
  ggmap and ggplot2 packages and Google API for geocoding data as 
  necessary. It implements smart logic to choose map tiles to place
  geocoded data appropriately, and it also automatically geocodes 
  data if necessary (Google API restrictions apply).

* Due to geocoding and map API restrictions `createMap` supports 
  function caching suggesting function `memoise` of memoise package. 
  (other functions are fine too). Properly following suggested practices 
  should significantly optimize both peformance and API usage when geocoding
  or retrieving maps.

* `compute`: for executing arbitrary aggregations on Aster tables.

* `computeBarchart`: for computing data for barchart visualizations. This
  is different from `computeHistogram` as barchart is defined on factors
  (categorical data) witch doesn't support defining bins like in histograms.

* `computePercentiles`: for computing multiple percentiles across one or 
  many subsets of a table in one go. Results are suitable for function
  `createBoxplot` (see next).

* `createBoxplot`: visualizes boxplots for single column across one or
  multiple subsets.

* `computeLm`: compute linear model coefficients similar to lm function but
  all performed inside Aster.

ENHANCEMENTS

* added parameter `test` to compute- functions (functions that access and 
  manipulate data in Aster) to produce SQL without executing it. Thus, when 
  `test=TRUE` function returns string containing SQL that would have run
  in Aster.

* package depedencies moved from Depends to Imports section of DESCRIPTION file 
  except for RODBC package. Keeping RODBC in Depends because toaster requires 
  access to RODBC connection object and to its function `odbcConnect`. Other 
  packages are not exposed by toaster functions so accessing them would have 
  been needed only for advanced usage (if any).
  if you use any function from the packages other than RODBC then those packages 
  should be loaded with `library` or `require` or use their namespace. 

* facet parameter now supports both one-value and 2-value vector (if parameter 
  is longer than the rest of values are ignored). Single value defines column
  name for wrapping facets in 1 or more column lattice. Two values define pair
  of columns to place facets in 2-dimensional grid for each combination of 
  values found.

* `createHistogram` supports trend lines with parameter trendLine=TRUE.

* `computeHeatmap` converts dimension and facet columns to factors by default.
  If undesired set parameter dimAsFactor = FALSE to disable (not recommended
  with heat maps). 

* `computeHeatmap` now supports withMelt to melt result using function melt
  from package reshape2. This option simplifies visualizating with facets.

* `createBubblechart` now supports scaling shapes by size (default) or by area.
  Correspondingly, use shapeSizeRange when scaling by size; and shapeMaxSize
  when scaling by area.

* `createBubblechart` added parameters to control label positioning and 
  formatting. All parameters that position and format label text start
  with prefix "label" now. Old parameters textSize, textColour, and 
  textVJust renamed to labelSize, labelColour, labelVJust. 

* `createPopPyramid` support for facets.

* added utility method to list Aster data types: `getNumericTypes`, 
  `getCharacterTypes`, `getTemporalTypes`.

* `computeAggregates` is not an alias anymore and it replaced function
  `compute` which is no more.
